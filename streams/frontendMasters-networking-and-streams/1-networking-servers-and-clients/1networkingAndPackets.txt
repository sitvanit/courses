/** Networking and Packets **/

TCP - reliable transport:
if a packet is not acknowledged (ACK) on the other end, it gets resent.

UDP - unreliable transport:
packets are sent but there is no confirmation that the packet was received at the other end.

we will use UDP in streaming audio/video/games, where you don't want to resend things that didn't get right.
It's more common to use TCP for everything audio/videos/games as well.
