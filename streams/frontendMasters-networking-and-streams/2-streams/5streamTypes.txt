/** Stream Types **/

1. readable - produces data: you can pipe FROM it.
readable.pipe(A)
paused mode - default behavior with automatic backpressure (pipe).
flowing mode - data is consumed as soon as chunks are available. turn on flowing mode with: stream.resume().

2. writable - consumes data: you can pipe TO it.
A.pipe(writable)

3. transform - consumes data, producing transformed data (concat-stream). readable and writable.
A.pipe(transform).pipe(B)


4. duplex - consumes data separately from producing data.
A.pipe(duplex).pipe(A)
like a telephone.
input is decoupled from output but they can work together.
both sides can be talking on the same time.
