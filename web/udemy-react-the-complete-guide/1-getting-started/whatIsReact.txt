What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
User interfaces is what the user sees.
React is all about components.
React components can be thought of writing HTML elements.

Why React?
UI state becomes difficult to handle with Vanilla JavaScript.
It slows us to focus on business logic, and not preventing your app from exploding.
It's written by a big community, and the framework creators probably wrote better code.
Therefore it's highly efficient and fast.
Huge ecosystem, active community, high performance.

React Alternatives
Angular
Vue
JQuery is not an alternative, it's just trversing the DOM.

There are two kinds of applications we can build:
* Single Page Applications - Only one HTML page, content is rendered on client - more popular today, because you don't need to go to the server in order to reload the page.
  All of he page built with react components.
  Typically only one ReactDOM.render() call.
* Multi Page Applications - Multiple HTML pages, content is rendered on server (each page has a different url).
  There are react components but not all is managed by react.
  Typically ReactDOM.render() call per widget.
