# Pod is the smallest deployable object in the Kubernetes object model.
# A Pod represents processes running on your Cluster.
# A Pod encapsulates an applicationâ€™s container (or, in some cases, multiple containers), storage resources, a unique
# network IP, and options that govern how the container(s) should run. A Pod represents a unit of deployment: a single
# instance of an application in Kubernetes, which might consist of either a single container or a small number of
# containers that are tightly coupled and that share resources.

# Each API version defines a different set of 'objects' we can use
apiVersion: v1
# kind represents the kind of object that we'd like to create
# Pod object is used to run a container
