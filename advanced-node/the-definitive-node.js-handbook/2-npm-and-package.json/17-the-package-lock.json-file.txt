/ *** The package-lock.json file ***/

The package-lock.json file is automatically generated when installing node packages.
The goal of the file is to keep track of the exact version of every package that is installed so that a product is 100%
reproducible in the same way even if packages are updated by their maintainers.
This solves a very specific problem that package.json left unsolved. In package.json you can set which versions you want
to upgrade to (patch or minor), using the semver notation (~ ^).
If you specify exact versions, like 0.13.0 in the example, you are not affected by this problem.

The package-lock.json file needs to be committed to your Git repository, so it can be fetched by other people.

The dependencies versions will be updated in the package-lock.json file when you run npm update.
