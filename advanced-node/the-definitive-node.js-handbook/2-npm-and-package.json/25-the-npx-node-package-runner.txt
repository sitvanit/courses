/** The npx Node Package Runner **/

npx is a very cool way to run the Node.js codes, and provides many useful features.

If you don’t want to install npm, you can install npx as a standalone package.
npx lets you run code built with Node.js and published through the npm registry.

This is pretty useful, mostly because:
you don’t need to install anything
you can run different versions of the same command, using the syntax @version

npx cowsay "Hello"
npx vue create my-vue-app
npx create-react-app my-react-app


un some code using a different Node.js version
npx node@6 -v #v6.14.3
npx node@8 -v #v8.11.3

This helps to avoid tools like nvm or the other Node version management tools.


Run arbitrary code snippets directly from a URL
npx does not limit you to the packages published on the npm registry.
