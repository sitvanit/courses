/** npm global or local packages **/

npm install <package-name>
npm install -g <package-name>

A package should be installed globally when it provides an executable command that you run from the shell (CLI), and
itâ€™s reused across projects.

Great examples of popular global packages which you might know are:
npm
create-react-app
vue-cli
grunt-cli
mocha
react-native-cli
gatsby-cli
forever
nodemon


You probably have some packages installed globally already on your system. You can see them by running:
npm list -g --depth 0
