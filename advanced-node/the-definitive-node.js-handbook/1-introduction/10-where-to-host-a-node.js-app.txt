/*** Where to host a Node.js app ***/
from simplest and constrained to more complex and powerful


/** Simplest option ever: local tunnel **/

/** ngrok **/
Using it, you can just type ngrok PORT and the PORT you want is exposed to the internet. You will get a ngrok.io
domain, but with a paid subscription you can get a custom URL as well as more security options (remember that you
are opening your machine to the public Internet).

/** localtunnel **/
Another service you can use is localtunnel.


/** Zero configuration deployments **/

/** Glitch **/
Glitch is a playground and a way to build your apps faster than ever, and see them live on their own glitch.com
subdomain. You cannot currently have a a custom domain, and there are a few restrictions in place, but it’s really
great to prototype.

/** Codepen **/
Codepen is an amazing platform and community. You can create a project with multiple files, and deploy it with a
custom domain.

/** Serverless **/
A way to publish your apps, and have no server at all to manage, is Serverless. Serverless is a paradigm where you
publish your apps as functions, and they respond on a network endpoint (also called FAAS — Functions As A Service).

/** PAAS **/
PAAS stands for Platform As A Service. These platforms take away a lot of things you should otherwise worry about
when deploying your application.

/** Zeit Now **/
You just type now in your terminal, and it takes care of deploying your application. There is a free version with
limitations, and the paid version is more powerful. You simply forget that there’s a server, you just deploy the app.

/** Nanobox **/

/** Heroku **/

/** Microsoft Azure **/
Azure is the Microsoft Cloud offering.

/** Google Cloud Platform **/


/** Virtual Private Server **/
In this section you find the usual suspects, ordered from more user friendly to less user friendly:
Digital Ocean, Linode, Amazon Web Services.
Since they provide an empty Linux machine on which you can work, there is no specific tutorial for these.

/** Bare metal **/
Another solution is to get a bare metal server, install a Linux distribution, connect it to the internet.
