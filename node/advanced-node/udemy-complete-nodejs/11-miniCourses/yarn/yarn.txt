/*** Yarn ***/

Yarn is an alternative to npm. It's faster, more secure, and easier to use. You don't need to change a line of code to
switch.
Yarn is a new package manager released by Facebook. It aims to replace your existing workflow will maintaining 100%
compatibility with the npm registry.

Hereâ€™s why you should switch:

Yarn is faster and caches modules to speed up future installs.
The Yarn commands are intuitive.
Yarn is built around security and reliability.


/** Init a yarn project **/

yarn init --yes
(npm init --yes)
it will create the package.json with default values


/** Install a package **/

yarn add <package_name>
(npm install <package_name>)
it will add yarn.lock file with the dependency (instead of package-lock.json).
in the package.json we have the range of versions (^3.2.1) in the yarn.lock we have the exact version (3.4.5).

yarn add <package_name> --dev
(npm install <package_name> --dev)


/** Uninstall a package **/

yarn remove <package_name>
(npm uninstall <package_name>)

yarn global remove <package_name>
(npm uninstall -g <package_name>)


/** Update (upgrade/downgrade) a package version **/

yarn upgrade <package_name>@3.0.0
(mpm update <package_name>@3.0.0)
package.json and yarn.lock will be with 3.0.0 version

to upgrade to the latest:
yarn upgrade <package_name>
(mpm update <package_name>)

yarn global upgrade <package_name>
(mpm update -g <package_name>)


/** Check if the current packages version is updated **/

yarn outdated
(npm outdated)


/** Install node modules **/

yarn install
(npm install)

yarn global add <package_name>
(npm install -g <package-name>)


/** Clean yarn cache **/

yarn cache clean


/** Scripts in package.json **/

yarn run
will list out all of the scripts we can run.

or a specific script:
yarn run start


/** Change from npm to yarn **/

benchmark:
1. time npm install (check how much time it takes to install the modules with npm) (took 50 sec)
2. yarn cache clean (before the install we'll clean the cache)
3. delete node_modules
4. yarn install (took 36 sec)
5. delete node_modules
6. yarn install (in the second time with the cache it took 18 sec)

just add yarn:
1. delete node_modules
2. delete package-lock.json
3. yarn install
