/** a brief history of node.js **/
Node.js is just 9 years old (since 2009).
In comparison, JavaScript is 23 years old and the web as we know it is 25 years old.

JavaScript is a programming language that was created at Netscape as a scripting tool to manipulate web pages inside
their browser, Netscape Navigator.
Part of the business model of Netscape was to sell Web Servers, which included an environment called
“Netscape LiveWire”, which could create dynamic pages using server-side JavaScript. So the idea of server-side
JavaScript was not introduced by Node.js, it’s old just like JavaScript — but at the time it was not successful.
The JavaScript engines performance bar raised considerably thanks to the browser competition battle, which is still
going strong. Development teams behind each major browser work hard every day to give us better performance, which is
a huge win for JavaScript as a platform. Chrome V8, the engine that Node.js uses under the hood, is one of those and
in particular it’s the Chrome JavaScript engine.
