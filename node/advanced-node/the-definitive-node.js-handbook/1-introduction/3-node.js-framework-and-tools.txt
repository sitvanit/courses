/** Node.js is a low-level platform **/
To make things easier and more interesting for developers, thousands of libraries were built upon Node.js.

/** Express **/
One of the most simple yet powerful ways to create a web server. Its minimalist approach and unopinionated focus on
the core features of a server is key to its success.

/** Meteor **/
An incredibly powerful full-stack framework, empowering you with an isomorphic approach to building apps with
JavaScript and sharing code on the client and the server. Once an off-the-shelf tool that provided everything, it now
integrates with front-end libraries such as React, Vue and Angular. Meteor can be used to create mobile apps as well.

/** Koa **/
Built by the same team behind Express, Koa aims to be even simpler and smaller, building on top of years of
knowledge. The new project was born out of the need to create incompatible changes without disrupting the existing
community.

/** Next.js **/
This is a framework to render server-side rendered React applications.

/** Micro **/
This is a very lightweight server to create asynchronous HTTP microservices.

/** Socket.io **/
This is a real-time communication engine to build network applications.
