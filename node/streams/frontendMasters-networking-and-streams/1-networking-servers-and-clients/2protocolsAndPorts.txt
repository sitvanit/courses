The language that computer programs speak to each other

HTTP       - browse web pages
HTTPS      - browse web pages with encryption
SMTP       - send and receive emails
IMAP, POP3 - load emails from an inbox
IRC        - chat (old)
FTP        - file transfer (not uses much anymore)
SSH        - remote shell over an encrypted connection
SSL        - low-level secure data transfer (used by HTTPS)


/** ports **/

Each computer can have many services.
A port is a number between 1 and 65535 that differentiates among the services on a system.

Customary ports
Any service can listen on any port, but there are customary ports for many protocols:

21   FTP
22   SSH
25   SMTP
80   HTTP
443  HTTPS
3306 MYSQL
5432 POSTGRESQL
5984 COUCHDB
6667 IRC

By default, systems can only listen to ports below 1024 as the root user (sudo)
