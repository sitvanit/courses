/** Servers **/

Other times, they mean a computer that is configured to run server programs.

Any computer can be a server.


/** Clients **/

Clients are computer programs that connect to servers.
Initiate a connection.

Any computer can be a client.


/** Peer to Peer **/

Aside from servers and clients, there is a third role in computer network: peer.
In a peer to peer network, clients establish connections directly to other clients.
Nodes in the network are symmetric with fixed central servers.
everything is both the client and both the server at the same time.
peers also listening for connections and also initiate connections.
Examples of peer to peer protocols: bittorrent, webrtc (peer to peer from web browsers like audio chats).
