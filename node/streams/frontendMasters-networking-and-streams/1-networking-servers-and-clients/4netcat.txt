/** netcat **/

netcat can create TCP and UDP connections and servers.

create a server that listen for incoming connections on port 400:
nc -l 4000

connect to that server from another terminal:
nc localhost 4000

now you can chat between client and server

This is more or less how protocols or servers and clients talk.
with netcat the number of client is limited to 1.
