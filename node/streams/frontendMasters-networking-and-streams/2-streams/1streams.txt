/** Streams **/

node.js has a handy interface for shuffling data around called streams.

just like how in unix we can pipe command together:
history | grep git

with streams, we can operate on data chunk by chunk, without buffering everything into memory.
This means we can write programs that operate on very large files.
It also means we can have hundreds or thousand of concurrent streams without using much memory.
