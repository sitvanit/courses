/** How to use the Node.js REPL **/

REPL stands for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop.

in order to run a file:
node script.js

/** autocomplete **/
If we omit the filename, we use it in REPL mode:
node
and than you can write your code:
>
use tab for autocomplete.

Exploring JavaScript objects
Try entering the name of a JavaScript class, like Number, add a dot and press tab.
You can inspect the globals you have access to by typing global. and pressing tab.

/** _ **/
If after some code you type _, that is going to print the result of the last operation.

/** Dot commands **/
.help: shows the dot commands help
.editor: enables editor more, to write multiline JavaScript code with ease. Once you are in this mode, enter ctrl-D to run the code you wrote.
.break: when inputting a multi-line expression, entering the .break command will abort further input. Same as pressing ctrl-C.
.clear: resets the REPL context to an empty object and clears any multi-line expression currently being input.
.load: loads a JavaScript file, relative to the current working directory
.save: saves all you entered in the REPL session to a file (specify the filename)
.exit: exists the repl (same as pressing ctrl-C two times)
