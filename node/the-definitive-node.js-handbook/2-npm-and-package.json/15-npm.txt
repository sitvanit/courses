/** global install **/
The npm root -g command will tell you where that exact location is on your machine.

On macOS or Linux this location could be /usr/local/lib/node_modules.
On Windows it could be C:\Users\YOU\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules

If you use nvm to manage Node.js versions, however, that location would differ.
I for example use nvm and my packages location was shown as/Users/flavio/.nvm/versions/node/v8.9.0/lib/node_modules.

/Users/sitvanit/.nvm/versions/node/v8.9.0/lib/node_modules
