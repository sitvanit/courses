/* Update all the Node dependencies to their latest version */
When you install a package using npm install <packagename>, the latest available version of the package is downloaded
and put in the node_modules folder.
now in the package.json:
"<package>": "^x.x.x"

If there is a new minor or patch release and we type npm update, the installed version is updated, and the
package-lock.json file diligently filled with the new version.
package.json remains unchanged.

/* To discover new releases of the packages */
npm outdated

/* To update to a new major version all the packages */
install the npm-check-updates package globally:
npm install -g npm-check-updates

then run it:
ncu -u

This will upgrade all the version hints in the package.json file, to dependencies and devDependencies, so npm can
install the new major version.

You are now ready to run the update:
npm update
