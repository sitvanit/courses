Triggers are SQL statements that are automatically run when a specific tables is changed
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
  trigger_time trigger_event ON table_name FOR EACH ROW
  BEGIN
  ...
  END;

trigger_time: BEFORE/AFTER
trigger_event: INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE


Listing triggers
SHOW TRIGGERS;

Removing trigger
DROP TRIGGER trigger_name;


Triggers can make debugging hard!
